My project models influence as a function of connectivity rather than content, using a dual-layer system: (1) Macro layer: OSINT and BGP/AS topology analysis to identify national-scale internet fragility and single points of failure. (2) Micro layer: Passive RF analysis of civilian wireless micro-networks (BLE/UWB/IoT, e.g., AirTags) to model physical convergence zones and pattern-of-life as “influence terrain.”
